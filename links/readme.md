## This is the source of 0a.io (version 3.1)

0a.io (v 3.1) uses Jekyll (v 2.4.0) from [the github-pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem).

To run it, simply do

```
jekyll serve
```

or (if you are using bundler)

```
bundler exec jekyll serve
```

If you are new to Jekyll & have 3 minutes to spare & want to make a customized github page, you would probably find this useful: *[Jekyll in 3 minutes](http://0a.io/Jekyll-in-3min-for-your-GitHub-page/)*.

No JavaScript library or framework are used in 0a.io (besides its home page which uses a bit of Angular and with the exceptions of a few articles that rely on some old jQuery widget I wrote).

Here is a [link](https://github.com/0a-/0a-2.0) to the source of 0a.io version 2.0 (built on Meteor).
